**Privet, there! This is repository where Maga Alkhasov collect his steps from journey to learn programming again**

## JavaScript

#### 00 ¬ Variables

I already know how to work with variables in JS, but now I met with new way and see the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`;

#### 01 ¬ Functions

Like in previous step, I know something about how play with functions (classic ones) but now I learned modern and arrow functions. Also write some experiments with callbacks.

#### 02 ¬ Objects

Clear new entity, and oh yes, I love opportunities of objects. Write the cat life simulator (1/10) with log of actions and print life log features into DOM. Get a cat, say meow, feed, stroke, feel happy. (But actually, I like dogs)

#### 03 ¬ Arrays

Little bit closely learned arrays and default array methods. I hope my way to use objects isn't a bad pattern, because I wrote sort of tic-tac-toe game just use only one object which contain all game functionality and params in it. Checking winner works too!

#### 04 ¬ Challenge #1

I found JS exercises (actually it is JavaScript Basics course) on HTML Academy website, which is good education project for beginners in web development, maybe the best in russian. So, a not a long thinking, I challenge myself to do all easy and medium level exercises on it, and maybe some hard one if I understand they will not claim much time. Timeline, where every string is one evening, 2-3 hours:

> - First 3 of 7 chapters, which contained 56 theoretical exercises and 22 practical
> - 4 and 5 chapters, which contained 50 theoretical exercises and 14 practical (just two about functions :C)
> - Least 6 and 7 chapters, which contained 44 theoretical exercises and 4 practical

Challenge completed by 3 evenings.

#### 05 ¬ Ternary conditionals, For Of, Spread Syntax

Early I saw ternary conditionals `a > b ? a : b` and did not know how they works, but now I read some and understand them. Spread syntax `...` just surprized me, I undertand how it works, but not much of ideas how to use is. Statement `for of` also new for me, I guess it is pretty useful and replace a lot of traditional loops `for(let i=0; i<a; i++)`

#### 06 ¬ Closures, High-order functions and Methods

I'll not hide, I didn't understand closures by the first try, not the second try, only after half an hour I said in mind "Aha, got it", because of things like `[[scope]]` and lexical environment. Partly (I guess) I understood the high-order functions and thinking method of them, just need more practice and look over other's code.

#### 07 ¬ Classes and Symbols

Earlier in university I met with object-oriented programming and classes, but now I looked at them in fresh eye. Was understand how to make new instances of class iterable, I succeeded at the first try but with thoughts "it works, but how?" and only after exercises form book I wrote a new iterable class by memory. I read sections about symbols but quickly forget details of them, need repeat and more practice.

#### 08 ¬ Errors

Kept looking deeper and now read about `try{} catch{} finally{}` construction with `Error` objects which need to `throw` if flow has exception. Tried to write several, looks easy, but I guess true is not.

#### 09 ¬ Regular Expressions

Powerful and painful. Hate when can't quickly write regexp that I want, love when regexp work extaclty like I need.

## Pug/Stylus

#### 00 ¬ Basics

I already know how to write common html tags and css styles, but for improving speed and convenience I started learning Pug template engine and Stylus stylesheet preprocessor.

_Currently I freezed my learing of pug and stylus, but still like them both_

## React

_For this learning part each step will be in one folder (react), but steps of journey like earlier will declared below_

#### 00 ¬ Hello world

I'm very interest at React last two years at least. JS learnings that I started is fundament and preparing for to start touching React. So, React-Hello-World achievement unlocked.

#### 01 ¬ First app

I looked over create-react-app build setup, run, it works. But I need to back to learn common js and practice more, because I'm not feel ready... but I could not.

#### 02 ¬ Nested components

I created `class Pokemon` by extends `React.Component`, which calls Pokemon component, need to get used to terminology. Each pokemon has properties form `pokemonsDatabase`. Then I created `Pokemons` component with two instances of `Pokemon` and add click event to `Pokemon` which update instance to new one.

#### 03 ¬ Props and State

Coded little bit more complex components with generating childres form "database", add evenlisteners `onClick`. Worked with lists and keys.

#### 04 ¬ Styled Components and React Router

Styled components just surprised me about how they handy to use. Don't know about large projects but for small experiments it's just perfect solution. React router surprised me too, I thought even simple router is hard to code, but with [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) package it's simple as can be.

#### 05 ¬ Lifting state up

At the start of this step I knew about react elements but not much about how to use them for usefull things. For fill the gap I coded the page with table which has header rows and common rows, search field and filter option. Table may any size and any count of ony rows. Search and filter functionality follows the "source of truth" clue, I used hierarchy of nested props for lifting state up.

## Server

#### 01 ¬ Start with Express

#### 02 ¬ Connect to File Server
