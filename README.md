**Privet, here! This is repository where Maga Alkhasov collect his steps from journey to learn programming again**

## JavaScript

#### 00 ¬ Variables

I already know how to work with variables in JS, but now I meet with new way and see the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`;

#### 01 ¬ Functions

Like in previous step, I know something about how play with functions (classic ones) but now I learned modern and arrow functions. Also write some experiments with callbacks.

#### 02 ¬ Objects

Clear new entity, and oh yes, I love opportunities of objects. Write the cat life simulator (1/10) with log of actions and print life log features into DOM. Get a cat, say meow, feed, stroke, feel happy. (But actually, I like dogs)

#### 03 ¬ Arrays

Little bit closely learned arrays and default array methods. I hope my way to use objects isn't a bad pattern, because I wrote sort of tic-tac-toe game just use only one object which contain all game functionality and params in it. Checking winner works too!

#### 04 ¬ Challage #1

I found JS exercises on HTML Academy website, which is good education project for beginners in web development, maybe the best in russian. So, a not a long thinking, I challenge myself to do all easy and medium level exercises on it, and maybe some hard one if I understand they will not claim much time. On the first evening I completed 3 of 7 chapters, which contained 56 theoretical exercises and 22 practical. Now become second evening and I continue clicking on keyboard.
