**Hola, there! This is repository where Maga Alkhasov collect his steps from journey to learn programming again**

## JavaScript

**00-Variables**
I already know how to work with variables in JS, but now I meet with new way and see the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`;

**01-Functions**
Like in previous step, I know something about how play with functions (classic ones) but now I learned modern and arrow functions. Also write some experiments with callbacks.

**02-Objects**
Clear new entity, and oh yes, I love opportunities of objects. Write cat life simulator (1/10) with logging actions and printing log into DOM. Get a cat, say meow, feed, stroke, feel happy. (But actually, I like dogs)
