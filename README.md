**Hola, there! This is repository where Maga Alkhasov collect his steps from journey to learn programming again**

## JavaScript

#### 00-Variables

I already know how to work with variables in JS, but now I meet with new way and see the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`;

#### 01-Functions

Like in previous step, I know something about how play with functions (classic ones) but now I learned modern and arrow functions. Also write some experiments with callbacks.

#### 02-Objects

Clear new entity, and oh yes, I love opportunities of objects. Write cat life simulator (1/10) with logging actions and printing log into DOM. Get a cat, say meow, feed, stroke, feel happy. (But actually, I like dogs)

#### 03-Arrays

Little bit closely learned arrays and default array methods. I hope my way to use objects isn't a bad pattern, because I wrote sort of tic-tac-toe game just use only one object which contain all game functionality and params in it. Checking winner works too!
