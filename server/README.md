## Server

#### 01 ¬ Start with Express

So, truth is I tried express.js earlier, approximately 4 years ago, when I found node.js, but truth also is I forgot everything, that's why I have to achieve «Hello, world!» again.

#### 02 ¬ Routing

Build several `GET`,`POST` routes, logged send information. Emulated database with variable on server. Found Paw application for generating requests and collecting API.
