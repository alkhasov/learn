## JavaScript

#### 00 ¬ Variables

I already know how to work with variables in JS, but now I met with new way and see the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`;

#### 01 ¬ Functions

Like in previous step, I know something about how play with functions (classic ones) but now I learned modern and arrow functions. Also write some experiments with callbacks.

#### 02 ¬ Objects

Clear new entity, and oh yes, I love opportunities of objects. Write the cat life simulator (1/10) with log of actions and print life log features into DOM. Get a cat, say meow, feed, stroke, feel happy. (But actually, I like dogs)

#### 03 ¬ Arrays

Little bit closely learned arrays and default array methods. I hope my way to use objects isn't a bad pattern, because I wrote sort of tic-tac-toe game just use only one object which contain all game functionality and params in it. Checking winner works too!

#### 04 ¬ Challenge #1

I found JS exercises (actually it is JavaScript Basics course) on HTML Academy website, which is good education project for beginners in web development, maybe the best in russian. So, a not a long thinking, I challenge myself to do all easy and medium level exercises on it, and maybe some hard one if I understand they will not claim much time. Timeline, where every string is one evening, 2-3 hours:

> - First 3 of 7 chapters, which contained 56 theoretical exercises and 22 practical
> - 4 and 5 chapters, which contained 50 theoretical exercises and 14 practical (just two about functions :C)
> - Least 6 and 7 chapters, which contained 44 theoretical exercises and 4 practical

Challenge completed by 3 evenings.

#### 05 ¬ Ternary conditionals, For Of, Spread Syntax

Early I saw ternary conditionals `a > b ? a : b` and did not know how they works, but now I read some and understand them. Spread syntax `...` just surprized me, I undertand how it works, but not much of ideas how to use is. Statement `for of` also new for me, I guess it is pretty useful and replace a lot of traditional loops `for(let i=0; i<a; i++)`

#### 06 ¬ Closures, High-order functions and Methods

I'll not hide, I didn't understand closures by the first try, not the second try, only after half an hour I said in mind "Aha, got it", because of things like `[[scope]]` and lexical environment. Partly (I guess) I understood the high-order functions and thinking method of them, just need more practice and look over other's code.

#### 07 ¬ Classes and Symbols

Earlier in university I met with object-oriented programming and classes, but now I looked at them in fresh eye. Was understand how to make new instances of class iterable, I succeeded at the first try but with thoughts "it works, but how?" and only after exercises form book I wrote a new iterable class by memory. I read sections about symbols but quickly forget details of them, need repeat and more practice.

#### 08 ¬ Errors

Kept looking deeper and now read about `try{} catch{} finally{}` construction with `Error` objects which need to `throw` if flow has exception. Tried to write several, looks easy, but I guess true is not.

#### 09 ¬ Regular Expressions

Powerful and painful, hate because I can't quickly write regexp that I want, love when regexp work extaclty like to need.
