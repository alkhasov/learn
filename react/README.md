## React

_For this learning part each step will be in one folder (react), but steps of journey like earlier will declared below_

#### 00 ¬ Hello world

I'm very interest at React last two years at least. JS learnings that I started is fundament and preparing for to start touching React. So, React-Hello-World achievement unlocked.

#### 01 ¬ First app

I looked over create-react-app build setup, run, it works. But I need to back to learn common js and practice more, because I'm not feel ready... but I could not.

#### 02 ¬ Nested components

I created `class Pokemon` by extends `React.Component`, which calls Pokemon component, need to get used to terminology. Each pokemon has properties form `pokemonsDatabase`. Then I created `Pokemons` component with two instances of `Pokemon` and add click event to `Pokemon` which update instance to new one.

#### 03 ¬ Props and State

Coded little bit more complex components with generating childres form "database", add evenlisteners `onClick`. Worked with lists and keys.

## create-react-app scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload after edits.<br>
Also see print lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
