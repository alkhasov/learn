## Svelte

I see mentions of Svelte more than year and during 8th of May I decided to meet with the ideas come from Svelte.

#### 00 ¬ Basics

Started with official tutorials at [svelte.dev/tutorial/basics](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)

#### 01 ¬ Reactivity

At first eye there is no additional logic, works as it should, but then appears nesting components with capital first letter rule and some new sytax like `$:` for depending logic (?)

#### 02 ¬ Logics

Svelte uses a pinch of sugar with logic operators. It's look like wrapping common operators for a new using feature. Amazed by `await this then value` case.

#### 03 ¬ Events

Handling events quite easy, but tutorial has no proper pracite to reinforce knowledge. I had some struggle with forwarding events and with understanding what `stopPropagation` is.

#### 04 ¬ Bindings
